## The simple workflow to get started with Blogdown

I always want to start my own blog. I tried Medium because I really liked their simple neat interface, but the only thing it lacks of is the function to let me embed code in my article. Later I found blogdown and got excited to use it, but I almost gave up because I encounted few trivial problems. So I would like to share what I learned through this process to share my workflow based on the resources I searched along the way. 

1. Create a new **EMPTY** project (do not use "create website with Hugo", because I found out you can't view the website in your viewer this way).
2. Type blogdown::new_site() in the console.
3. Pick a them you like. 
   * choose a simple one at first. Your contents is more important than what fancy theme you pick and it'll be also hard to de-bug if something goes wrong with your fancy them
   * copy the user/repo from the **top left** position in github homepage and paste in "theme="
4. use **update_metadata** addin to refresh all your updates on your homepage (the configuration in the config.toml).
5. use **serve_site** to render your post updates.
   * the statement in the output shows the address to open your blog. For example: 'Serving the directory /Users/fanliu/Documents/Fan's Blog at <http://127.0.0.1:5216>'
   * this blog helps to solve the problem that I created contents in my post but it couldn't show up in the viewer:<https://knausb.github.io/2017/06/a-first-post-using-blogdown/>. I really appreciate the author to share what he experienced.

6. To create a new post: blogdown::new_post("test", ext = getOption("blogdown.ext", ".Rmd")). Use this extension argument to make it as Rmarkdown rather than default Markdown.
   
So just use these 5 simple steps, you can create your own website! I took many detours to get here so hope this post can help you start your website much easier!
